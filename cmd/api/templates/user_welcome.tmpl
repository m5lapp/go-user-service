Hi {{if .friendlyName}}{{.friendlyName}}{{else}}{{.name}}{{end}},

Thank you for registering for a new user account. We're excited to have you on board!

For future reference, your user ID is {{.userID}}.

Please send a request to the `PUT /v1/user/activate` endpoint with the following JSON
body to activate your account:

{"token": "{{.activationToken}}"}

Please note that this is a one-time use token and it will expire in three days.

Regards,

The User Service Team
